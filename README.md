LAMP2-Project1
==============

Fanshawe College LAMP2 Project One
The purpose of Project 1 is to introduce to you the purpose and complexity of data containers and collections. Upon completion you will be able to implement a singly and doubly linked list without the use of an array to store or manage the data of each node (element) in the lists, and create a tested and re-usable data container for future reference and implementations.
